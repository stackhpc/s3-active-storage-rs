It provides high level abstractions with low runtime overhead, a modern toolchain, and has a unique approach that provides safe automatic memory management without garbage collection. While the Rust standard library is not as comprehensive as some other \"batteries included\" languages, the crates.io ecosystem is relatively mature and provides a number of de-facto standard libraries. Reductionist is built on top of a number of popular open source components. A few properties make it relatively easy to build a conceptual mental model of how Reductionist works. All operations share the same request processing pipeline. The request processing pipeline for each request is a fairly linear sequence of steps. There is no persistent state. The only external service that is interacted with is an S3-compatible object store. The more challenging aspects of the system are the lower level details of asynchronous programming, memory management, the Rust type system and working with multi-dimensional arrays. A diagram of the request processing pipeline is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Request processing pipeline flow diagram The \"Perform numerical operation\" step depends on the type of numerical operation being performed. A diagram of this step for the sum operation is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Sum operation flow diagram Axum web server \u00b6 Axum is an asynchronous web framework that performs well in various benchmarks and is built on top of various popular components, including the hyper HTTP library. It integrates well with Tokio , the most popular asynchronous Rust runtime, and allows us to easily define an API route for each operation. Extractors make it easy to consume data from the request in a type-safe way. The operation request handler is the operation_handler function in src/app.rs . API request data \u00b6 The JSON request data is deserialised into the RequestData struct defined in src/models.rs using the serde library. Serde handles conversion errors at the type level, while further validation of request data invariants is performed using the validator crate. S3 object download \u00b6 Object data is downloaded from the object store using the AWS SDK . The S3Client struct in src/s3_client.rs provides a simplified wrapper around the AWS SDK. Typically we will be operating on a \"storage chunk\", a hyperslab within the larger dataset that the object contains. In this case a byte range is specified in the S3 GetObject request to avoid downloading the whole object. The AWS SDK is asynchronous and does provide a streaming response, however we read the whole storage chunk into memory to simplify later stages of the pipeline. Storage chunks are expected to be small enough (O(MiB)) that this should not be a problem. Construction of aws_sdk_s3::Client structs is a relatively slow task. A key performance improvement involves the use of a shared client object for each combination of object store URL and credentials. This is implemented using the S3ClientMap in src/s3_client.rs and benchmarked in benches/s3_client.rs . Downloaded storage chunk data is returned to the request handler as a Bytes object, which is a wrapper around a u8 (byte) array. Filters and compression \u00b6 When a variable in a netCDF, HDF5 or Zarr dataset is created, it may be compressed to reduce storage requirements. Additionally, prior to compression one or more filters may be applied to the data with the aim of increasing the compression ratio. When consuming such data, Reductionist needs to reverse any compression and filters applied. The filter pipeline is implemented in src/filter_pipeline.rs . First, if a compression algorithm is specified in the request data, the storage chunk is decompressed using the same algorithm. Currently the Gzip and Zlib algorithms are supported using the flate2 and zune-inflate libraries respectively. This mix of libraries was chosen based on performance benchmarks in benches/compression.rs . Compression is implemented in src/compression.rs . Next, if any filters are specified in the request data, they are decoded in reverse order. Currently the byte shuffle filter is supported. This filter reorders the data to place the Nth bytes of each data value together, with the aim of grouping leading zeroes. The shuffle filter is implemented in src/filters/shuffle.rs , and has several optimisations including loop unrolling that were benchmarked using benches/shuffle.rs . The Operation trait \u00b6 Here the implementation becomes specific to the requested operation (min, max, etc.). This is achieved using the Operation trait defined in src/operation.rs . /// Trait for active storage operations. /// /// This forms the contract between the API layer and operations. pub trait Operation { /// Execute the operation. /// /// Returns a [models::Response](crate::models::Response) object with response data. /// /// # Arguments /// /// * `request_data`: RequestData object for the request /// * `data`: [`Vec<u8>`] containing data to operate on. fn execute ( request_data : & models :: RequestData , data : Vec < u8 > , ) -> Result < models :: Response , ActiveStorageError > ; } This interface accepts the request data and a byte array containing the storage chunk data in its original byte order. On success, it returns a Response struct which contains a byte array of the response data as well as the data type, shape and a count of non-missing elements in the array. A second NumOperation trait with an execute_t method handles the dynamic dispatch between the runtime data type in the request data and the generic implementation for that type. Operations \u00b6 Each operation is implemented by a struct that implements the NumOperation trait. For example, the sum operation is implemented by the Sum struct in src/operations.rs . The Sum struct's execute_t method does the following: Zero copy conversion of the byte array to a multi-dimensional ndarray::ArrayView object of the data type, shape and byte order specified in the request data If a selection was specified in the request data, create a sliced ndarray::ArrayView onto the original array view If missing data was specified in the request data: Create an iterator over the array view that filters out missing data, performs the sum operation and counts non-missing elements Otherwise: Use the array view's native sum and len methods to take the sum and element count Convert the sum to a byte array and return with the element count The procedure for other operations varies slightly but generally follows the same pattern. Error handling \u00b6 The ActiveStorageError enum in src/error.rs describes the various errors that may be returned by the Reductionist API, as well as how to format them for the JSON error response body. Low-level errors are converted to higher-level errors and ultimately wrapped by ActiveStorageError . This is a common pattern in Rust and allows us to describe all of the errors that a function or application may return. Configuration \u00b6 Reductionist configuration is implemented in src/cli.rs using the clap library, and accepts command line arguments and environment variables. Resource management \u00b6 Reductionist supports optional restriction of resource usage. This is implemented in src/resource_manager.rs using Tokio Semaphores . This allows Reductionist to limit the quantity of various resources used at any time: S3 connections memory used for numeric data (this is more of a rough guide than a perfect limit) threads used for CPU-bound work CPU-bound work \u00b6 There is particular friction between the asynchronous and synchronous types of work in the system. Axum and Tokio very efficiently handle the asynchronous aspects such as the HTTP server and S3 object download. The other work such as decompression, filtering and numerical operations are more CPU-bound, and can easily block the Tokio runtime from efficiently handling asynchronous tasks. Two alternative methods were developed to alleviate this issue. The resource manager can limit the number of threads used for CPU-bound work, by default leaving one CPU core free for handling asynchronous tasks. Integration with Rayon , a library that provides a thread pool. Limited benchmarking was done to compare the two approaches, however the first appeared to have lower overhead. The second approach may leave the server more responsive if more CPU-heavy operations are used in future. Monitoring \u00b6 Prometheus metrics are implemented in src/metrics.rs and are exposed by the Reductionist API under the /metrics path. These include: incoming requests (counter) outgoing response (counter) response time (histogram) Tracing and profiling \u00b6 Reductionist integrates with Jaeger, a distributed tracing platform. Various sections of the request processing pipeline are instrumented with spans, making it easy to visualise the relative durations in the Jaeger UI. Testing with a sum over some CMIP6 temperature data, this showed that in terms of wall clock time, the S3 storage chunk download takes the majority of the time, followed by decompression, byte shuffle, and finally the actual numerical operation. Flame graphs created using flamegraph-rs were useful to visualise which parts of the code consume the most CPU cycles. This was useful to determine where to focus performance improvements, and showed that decompression is the most CPU-heavy task.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#architecture-and-implementation","text":"Reductionist is written in Rust , a language that is rapidly gaining popularity for a variety of use cases.

Continuous Integration (CI) \u00b6 GitHub Actions is used for CI for pull requests. It checks that the package builds, and passes various checks, unit and integration tests. Compliance/integration tests \u00b6 The S3 Active Storage compliance test suite should be updated to test any new features added to Reductionist. Code style \u00b6 Rust code style is enforced using cargo fmt . This command will modify the source code to resolve any code style issues. To check for code style issues without making changes, use cargo fmt -- --check . Linting \u00b6 Clippy is used to lint the source code. Use cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings . Unit tests \u00b6 A majority of the application code in Reductionist is unit tested, and any new code should include unit tests where practical. Unit tests in Rust code typically reside in the same file as the module being tested. Unit tests can be run using cargo test . Benchmarks \u00b6 Benchmark tests in the benches directory were created for various modules and used to make performance improvements. These can be run using cargo bench , or a specific benchmark with cargo bench --bench <benchmark name> Pre-commit hook \u00b6 A pre-commit hook is provided in tools/pre-commit that runs formatting, clippy, and unit tests. After cloning this repository, copy it to .git/hooks/pre-commit . Development environment \u00b6 Note For production deployments Reductionist provides an Ansible playbook to easily deploy it and supporting services to one or more hosts. See the deployment guide for details. There are various ways to run the Reductionist server for development purposes. Running in a container \u00b6 The simplest method is to run it in a container using a pre-built image: docker run -it --detach --rm --net = host --name reductionist ghcr.io/stackhpc/reductionist-rs:latest Images are published to GitHub Container Registry when the project is released. The latest tag corresponds to the most recent release, or you can use a specific release e.g. 0.1.0 . This method does not require access to the source code. Building a container image \u00b6 If you need to use unreleased changes, but still want to run in a container, it is possible to build an image. First, clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/stackhpc/reductionist-rs.git cd reductionist-rs make build The image will be tagged as reductionist . The image may be pushed to a registry, or deployed locally. make run Building a Reductionist binary \u00b6 If you prefer not to run the Reductionist server in a container, it will be necessary to build a binary. Building locally may also be preferable during development to take advantage of incremental compilation. Prerequisites \u00b6 This project is written in Rust, and as such requires a Rust toolchain to be installed in order to build it. The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is 1.78.0, due to a dependency on the AWS SDK . It may be necessary to use rustup rather than the OS provided Rust toolchain to meet this requirement. See the Rust book for toolchain installation. Build and run Reductionist \u00b6 First, clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/stackhpc/reductionist-rs.git cd reductionist-rs Next, use Cargo to build the package: cargo build --release The active storage server may be run using Cargo: cargo run --release Or installed to the system: cargo install --path . --locked Then run: reductionist Testing \u00b6 For simple testing purposes Minio is a convenient object storage server. Deploy Minio object storage \u00b6 Start a local Minio server which serves the test data: ./scripts/minio-start The Minio server will run in a detached container and may be stopped: ./scripts/minio-stop Note that object data is not preserved when the container is stopped. Upload some test data \u00b6 A script is provided to upload some test data to minio. In a separate terminal, set up the Python virtualenv then upload some sample data: # Create a virtualenv python3 -m venv ./venv # Activate the virtualenv source ./venv/bin/activate # Install dependencies pip install scripts/requirements.txt # Upload some sample data to the running minio server python ./scripts/upload_sample_data.py Compliance test suite \u00b6 Proxy functionality can be tested using the S3 active storage compliance suite . Making requests to active storage endpoints \u00b6 Request authentication is implemented using Basic Auth with the username and password consisting of your S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, respectively. If provided, these credentials are then used internally to authenticate with the upstream S3 source using standard AWS authentication methods . If no basic auth header is provided, an unauthenticated request will be made to S3. A basic Python client is provided in scripts/client.py .

Documentation is available on docs.rs . It is also possible to build the documentation locally: cargo doc --no-deps The resulting documentation is available under target/doc , and may be viewed in a web browser using file:///path/to/reductionist/target/doc/reductionist/index.html. Maintenance \u00b6 Updating dependencies \u00b6 Rust package dependencies are managed by Cargo . The [dependencies] section in Cargo.toml defines package dependencies and their version constraints. The [dev-dependencies] section includes additional dependencies for testing. In order to make builds reproducible, Cargo maintains a Cargo.lock file that captures the versions of all package dependencies. This even allows for multiple versions of a package to be used by a single Rust application, although this can lead to incompatibilities at runtime and should be avoided if possible. To update the versions in the Cargo.lock file, run cargo update , then inspect and commit the changes. Updating Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) \u00b6 Rust moves quickly, and it's sensible to keep up with the latest toolchain. With support for multiple installed versions of Rust and the separation provided by containers there is little reason to support old versions of Rust. The AWS SDK for Rust is particularly aggressive in updating its MSRV, and this often drives the MSRV of Reductionist. Updating the Reductionist MSRV requires making changes in a few places. rust-version in Cargo.toml FROM rust:<version> in Dockerfile toolchain in .github/workflows/publish.yml Prerequisites section in docs/contributing.md Updating the MSRV typically requires a few updates to the code to handle changes in the standard library, Clippy rules, etc. Create a release \u00b6 To update the version of Reductionist, set [package] version in Cargo.toml . Create a pull request, approve and merge it. When ready to release, draft a new release in GitHub, creating a new tag matching Reductionist's version, and auto-generating release notes. After the release is published, the publish.yml workflow will be triggered.
